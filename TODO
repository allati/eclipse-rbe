- Add configurable options for most (or all) visitor-related operations.
- Consider using common registr for resources (image). May use eclipse one.
- Consider merging the 2 tree providers and caching some visitor results
  for performance.

  IllegalArgumentException when trying to unescape
  malformed \uxxxx encoding (create an MalformedEncodingException?).
  Then parse normally?
- Display no icon when group is not a key.
- Investigate why the plugin won't open an external file 
  (using "Open External File" option).

- Import/Export feature
- Reporting of duplicate values (with an ignore list?)
- Display internationalized tooltips for most components
